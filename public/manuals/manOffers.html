          <p>On the <b>OFFERS</b> page you can download files, containing our offers, separated by lead time
          </p>
          <p>For your convenience, we have two kinds of offer files:
              <ul>
              <li>FULL files, containing items of all brands available in meaning lead time
              <li>BRAND files, containing only items of appropriate brand in meaning lead time
              </ul>
          </p>

          <p>All files have the same structure as follows:
              <ul>
              <li>BRAND  - unique code of the manufacturer in our system (* presents only in FULL files)</li>
              <li>PARTNUMBER - manufacturer's unique item number </li>
              <li>PRICE (USD) - price in USD from our warehouse, without further delivery (1USD =3.65 AED)</li>
              <li>CATALOG - unique logo of the supplier</li>
              <li>RATING - supply quality statistics</li>
              <li>QUANTITY – available quantity (is empty for "by order" items)</li>
              <li>WEIGHT - physical weight of the item in KG</li>
              <li>VOLUME - Volume weight of the item in KG</li>
              </ul>
              Each file also contains Delivery costs in appropriate columns:
              <ul>
              <li>EKBA (Ekaterinburg, RUSSIA)</li>
              <li>KIVA (Kiev, UKRAINE)</li>
              <li>MSKA (Moscow, RUSSIA)</li>
              </ul>
          </p>

          <p>To calculate your final price at the particular destination, you need to add the delivery cost to the PRICE (USD)
            <br/>
            <i>
              *if you have any special <b>discount</b>, please note, that discount <b>applies only for PRICE (USD)</b> and doesn’t apply for the delivery cost
            </i>
          </p>

          <p>There is an option also to download the offer files from our ftp-server. You need to contact our managers to get the access
